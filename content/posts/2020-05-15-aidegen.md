AIDEGen, presumably a shorthand for "Android IDE (helper) Generator", is a tool
in the AOSP source tree that allows working on system applications from within
an IDE like Android Studio that is normally only configured for non-platform app
development.

For more official information, see the [AIDEGen README][readme].

The `com.android.internal`, `SystemUI` etc. classes are not exposed via the
Android SDK for app developers, but the `aidegen` tool can generate them from a
working AOSP tree.

Build AIDEGen:
```
. build/envsetup.sh
lunch aosp_x86-userdebug
m aidegen
```

The generated `aidegen-dev` binary will be in
`out/host/linux-x86/bin/aidegen-dev`.
<!--
(and also duplicated in `out/soong/host/linux-x86/bin/aidegen-dev`, the files
have the same `sha256sum`) :-/
-->

Run it:
```
# Usage:
aidegen-dev -i s -n $package
# E.g.:
aidegen-dev SystemUI -i
```

<!--
> Do -\-help  
> I can't remember the proper flag for as  
> It can do intellij, as and vscode

`-n, -\-no_launch       Do not launch IDE.`
-->

Or a more practical example:
```
python3 out/soong/host/linux-x86/bin/aidegen-dev \
    -n \
    -s \
    -i s \
    packages/apps/Camera2
```

Though on Q, AIDEGen chokes on non-ASCII Java source files. You can
[patch that in][locator] or wait for master.

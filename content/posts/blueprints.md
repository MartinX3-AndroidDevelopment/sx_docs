`androidmk` is a tool to convert Makefile-style `Android.mk` files to
`Android.bp` "blueprint" files, which look like json and are faster to parse.  
YMMV, but they also seem more readable and largely prevent you from doing crazy
if-else and convoluted stuff as you'd be drawn to if using makefiles.  
As a downside, they're an "Android-ism" and make it harder for people to port
your software to a project that is not Android.

Use `make blueprint_tools` inside the AOSP tree to build the `androidmk` go
binary.

You can then copy the binary from `out/soong/host/linux-x86/bin/androidmk` to
your `~/.local/bin/` to use it outside the AOSP tree. Beware that the tool is
constantly being updated, so you might need to re-build it from time to time.

For the internal workings, and to get a mapping of make and soong variables, see
the source code inside [cmd/androidmk/android.go][source].

See this question about [androidmk on StackOverflow][so-androidmk].

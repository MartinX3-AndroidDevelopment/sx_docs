## sepolicy
`sepolicy` has new `neverallows`.

## ccache
`ccache` is no longer supported by default, the prebuilt `ccache` exec has been
removed.

See [build/core/ccache.mk][ccache-q]:

> We no longer provide a `ccache` prebuilt.
> 
> Ours was old, and had a number of issues that triggered non-reproducible
> results and other failures. Newer ccache versions may fix some of those
> issues, but at the large scale of our build servers, we weren't seeing
> significant performance gains from using `ccache` -- you end up needing very
> good locality and/or very large caches if you're building many different
> configurations.
> 
> Local no-change full rebuilds were showing better results, but why not just
> use incremental builds at that point?
> 
> So if you still want to use `ccache`, continue setting `USE_CCACHE`, but also
> set the `CCACHE_EXEC` environment variable to the path to your ccache
> executable.

Install `ccache` and set `export CCACHE_EXEC=/usr/bin/ccache` in your
`~/.bashrc`.

## Recovery needed for packaging OTAs
```sh
FAILED: ninja: unknown target 'otapackage'
```

To get OTA packaging for legacy devices to work via `make otapackage`, the
target device needs to enable building a recovery image explicitly now.

```make
PRODUCT_BUILD_RECOVERY_IMAGE := true
```

Since Android Pie/Q, certain OTA parameters are extracted from an
intermediate recovery image.

Devices are now supposed to use `BOARD_USES_RECOVERY_AS_BOOT` and as such the
build process - even for legacy devices that do not use recovery-as-boot - is
now structured such that it creates the boot image by first contructing a
recovery image and patching that.

On Pie, the recovery image was built if it wasn't disabled _explicitly:_
```make
# build/make/core/Makefile
ifeq (,$(filter true, $(TARGET_NO_KERNEL) $(TARGET_NO_RECOVERY)))
[... build recoveryimage]
```

On Q, building a recovery image must now be enabled since the recovery
buildvars, including `$(recovery_fstab)`, are guarded by
`BUILDING_RECOVERY_IMAGE`.  
See [AOSP Gerrit: Add BUILD_RECOVERY_IMAGE and BUILD_BOOT_IMAGE flags][gerrit-recovery].
```make
# build/make/core/board_config.mk
ifeq ($(BOARD_USES_RECOVERY_AS_BOOT),true)
  BUILDING_RECOVERY_IMAGE := true
else ifeq ($(PRODUCT_BUILD_RECOVERY_IMAGE),)
  ifdef BOARD_RECOVERYIMAGE_PARTITION_SIZE
    ifeq (,$(filter true, $(TARGET_NO_KERNEL) $(TARGET_NO_RECOVERY)))
      BUILDING_RECOVERY_IMAGE := true
    endif
  endif
else ifeq ($(PRODUCT_BUILD_RECOVERY_IMAGE),true)
  BUILDING_RECOVERY_IMAGE := true
endif
# build/make/core/Makefile
[...]
ifdef BUILDING_RECOVERY_IMAGE
  [...]
  ifdef TARGET_RECOVERY_FSTAB
    recovery_fstab := $(TARGET_RECOVERY_FSTAB)
  else
    recovery_fstab := $(strip $(wildcard $(TARGET_DEVICE_DIR)/recovery.fstab))
  endif
  [...]
endif # BUILDING_RECOVERY_IMAGE
```

Since `$(recovery_fstab)` is needed by `build_otatools_package`, failing to enable the
recovery image leads to the loss of the `otapackage` target. Simplified code:
```make
# build/make/core/Makefile
[...]
build_ota_package := true
ifeq ($(recovery_fstab),)
  build_ota_package := false
endif
[...]
ifeq ($(build_ota_package),true)
  [...]
  .PHONY: otapackage
  otapackage: $(INTERNAL_OTA_PACKAGE_TARGET)
[...]
endif # build_ota_package
```

<!-- h3 Removal of otapackage target
<div class="message">
  <h5>Note</h5>
  The following does not apply, setting `PRODUCT_BUILD_RECOVERY_IMAGE`
  re-enables OTA packaging.
</div>

Seems there is no more `make otapackage` on the master branch, though that seems
like a small mistake.
You can still build a flashable zip file via
```
make out/target/product/kagura/aosp_f8331-img-eng.builder.zip
```
Substitute `kagura`, `f8331`, `eng` and `builder` for your actual image name.
On Pie, the image used to be called `aosp_f8331-ota-eng.builder.zip`.

You will still not receive a flashable `.zip` file, but rather a compressed
archive with `system.img,` `vendor.img` and `boot.img` to flash manually.

## PATH restrictions
If some of your makefiles call `make`, `perl`, `gcc` or some other
host-installed tool directly, you will run into an error quite like this one:
```
Disallowed PATH tool "make" used: \
  []string{"make", "-j4", "-j8", "-C", "/home/[...]/kernel/", \
  "O=../../../../out/target/product/mydevice/obj/kernel/msm-4.9", \
  "ARCH=arm64", "CROSS_COMPILE=/home/[...]/aarch64-linux-android-", \
  "KCFLAGS=-mno-android"}
See https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/+/master/Changes.md#PATH_Tools for more information.
```

The stopgap solution is to set `export TEMPORARY_DISABLE_PATH_RESTRICTIONS=true`
in your build environment, but it is worth exploring the reasons behind this.

Beginning to dig further, not even inspecting the PATH works: 
```sh
builder@android:~/android$ get_build_var PATH

build/make/core/dumpvar.mk:29: error: PATH is obsolete. Do not use PATH directly.
See https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/+/master/Changes.md#PATH.
22:32:12 dumpvars failed with: exit status 1
```

One can modify [build/make/core/config.mk][config-path] to temporarily allow
using `PATH` by commenting out this line:
```
$(KATI_obsolete_var PATH,Do not use PATH directly. See $(CHANGES_URL)#PATH)
```

So, why all this?

### Reasons

With Android Q, Google has restricted the usage of tools in `$PATH`, ostensibly
to cut down on too much variance in build environments. Now, usage of "host
tools" [^1] which are not shipped as checked-in prebuilts is heavily discouraged.

The `$PATH` that is visible to the makefiles inside the Android build system is
now set via [build/soong/ui/build/path.go][soong-path] and only consists of:
`prebuilts/build-tools/path/linux-x86:out/.path`.

`prebuilts/build-tools/path/linux-x86` is made up of symlinks to prebuilt common
coreutils etc. such as `awk`, `cat`, `cp`, `python` and `tar`, some of which are
provided via a host `toybox`.

`.out/path/` is a bit more complicated. It only contains symlinks that all point
to a go binary named `path_interposer`. This `path_interposer` - source
[here][interposer] - checks whether the program the symlink points to is an
allowed `PATH` tool. Which host tools are allowed is specified in
[soong/build/paths/config.go][soong-paths-config-go]: They're either `Allowed`,
`Forbidden`, or allowed-but-logged(`Log`) (or some other obscure options).

### Measures
As suggested in the [Build System Changes advisory][stopusingpath], one should
stop relying on `$PATH` in makefiles directly, but if needed, commands can still
be invoked with one-off environment variables:
```make
$(OUT)/my-bin: $(MY_INTERMEDIATE)
	PATH=$$(cd device/ti/beagle_x15/hostcc; pwd):$$PATH \
	create-my-out-bin
```

As for invoking `make`, especially for kernels, using the full path to a
prebuilt `make` binary instead of relying on the host `/usr/bin/make` fixes the
issue. Google ships a prebuilt `make` in [prebuilts/build-tools/][prebuilts].
```make
# my-kernel.mk
MY_MAKE := \
	PATH="$(PWD)/prebuilts/my-prebuilts/bin:$$PATH" \
	$(PWD)/prebuilts/build-tools/linux-x86/bin/make
[...]
# Stop using $(MAKE) directly. Instead of:
#$(MAKE) -C $(OUT)/my-dir ...
# Use:
$(MY_MAKE) -C $(OUT)/my-dir ...
```
<!--
`get_build_var MAKE` evaluates to
`prebuilts/build-tools/linux-x86/bin/ckati --color_warnings --kati_stats MAKECMDGOALS=`.

For more kernel-specific information, including how you can switch to clang,
have a look at [Android Q: Compiling Kernels in-tree][q-intree].

### Addendum Jan 2021

A great example which lists this page as reference is
[this adaptation to Q][busybox] of `busybox` from the [android-x86 project][x86].

## GCC deprecation
GCC 4.9 is being ever more aggressively deprecated. A delay is added to every
call to the prebuilt GCC and a warning is shown - Google cheekily calls this a
"Sleep Constructor" [^2].

Current plans: See [GCC_4_9_DEPRECATION.md][clang-gcc-deprecation]

> - January 2019
>   - Move GCC binary to new file name.
>   - Create shell wrapper with old GCC binary name that calls new binary name.
>   - Shell wrapper print deprecation warning to stdout, with a link to more info.
> - April 2019
>   - Move GCC binary name.
>   - Add 1s sleep to wrapper.
> - July 2019
>   - Move GCC binary name.
>   - Total 3s sleep.
> - October 2019
>   - Move GCC binary name.
>   - Total 10s sleep.
> - January 2020
>   - Remove GCC from Android.

## New build.prop location
See system/core: init:
[Moving `/odm/build.prop` to `/odm/etc/build.prop`][buildprop]
There is no more fallback reading of `/odm/build.prop` anymore.

Moving /odm/build.prop to /odm/etc/buid.prop

In device root directory, we have the following symlinks:
  - /odm/app -> /vendor/odm/app
  - /odm/bin -> /vendor/odm/bin
  - /odm/etc -> /vendor/odm/etc
  ...

This allows the Generic System Image (GSI) to be used on both devices:
  1) Has a physical odm partition, where those symlink will be hidden
     when /odm is used as the mount point
  2) Has no physical odm partition and fallback to /vendor/odm/.

We can't just have the symlink /odm -> /vendor/odm, because the former
devices won't have /vendor/odm directory, which leads to mount failure
when the mount point /odm is resolved to /vendor/odm.

The existing /vendor/odm/build.prop won't be loaded in the latter
devices, because there is no symlink
    - /odm/build.prop -> /vendor/odm/build.prop.

Note that init blocks reading through direct symlinks (O_NOFOLLOW) so
the above symlink won't work either. This CL moves the odm build.prop
to /odm/etc/build.prop for init to load it (symlinks in earlier
components of the path will still be followed by O_NOFOLLOW).

Bug: 132128501
Test: boot a device and checks /odm/etc/build.prop is loaded

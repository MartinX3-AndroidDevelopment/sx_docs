## AOSP layout

When you set up your Android directory with `repo init`, what happens is the
Google `repo` tool creates a hidden `.repo` folder, which by default has a
`manifest.xml` file.

### manifest.xml and local_manifests
`manifest.xml` is actually a symbolic link to `.repo/manifests/default.xml`. It
contains a description of the directories needed to build android, and where to get
them. Those directories are all just git repositories that get cloned from
[android.googlesource.com](https://android.googlesource.com).
A `<remote>` is just a git remote base url with a default branch specified. A
`<project>` sets `name` and `path` as well as `remote` and `revision`(git
branch).  
Let's take this example:
```
<remote name="sony" fetch="https://github.com/sonyxperiadev/" />
<project path="hardware/qcom/gps" name="hardware-qcom-gps-sdm845" groups="device" remote="sony" revision="aosp/android-9.0.0_r11" />
```
This would just `git clone` the git repo from https://github.com/sonyxperiadev/hardware-qcom-gps-sdm845
into `hardware/qcom/gps`. Every time you run `repo sync` it would fetch the
latest version of the branch `aosp/android-9.0.0_r11` from GitHub.

Instead of editing `manifest.xml`, you can instead put your modifications
inside `.repo/local_manifests/`. This way, if the AOSP default manifest changes,
you do not have to re-apply your changes manually.

To get started with your own `local_manifests`, take a look at
[github.com/sonyxperiadev/local_manifests](https://github.com/sonyxperiadev/local_manifests). If you want to remove a default project, use `<remove-project>`.

### Modules
Every directory with an `Android.mk` or `Android.bp` file in it will get considered.

Most interesting to new developers might be the `frameworks`, `hardware`,
`kernel` and `packages` folders.

<!--
### Overlays
You can change e.g. `frameworks/base` manually and edit xml files there or add a
default wallpaper. But this means you have to fork the whole framework. It is
much easier to just add an `overlay` to your build which will overwrite whatever
is in `frameworks/base`. This way, you don't have to keep up to date with
changes in the framework code. See
[this example](https://git.ix5.org/felix/vendor-sony-ix5/src/commit/3bbeeb0d66b0951bd1c5ffe33ac642bcff353d71/ix5.mk#L54).

## Getting started

**You'll need:**

- [`local_manifests`](http://github.com/sonyxperiadev/local_manifests) from Sony
  (or [`local_manifests`](https://git.ix5.org/felix/local-manifests-ix5/) from
  me)
- `device-sony-common` from Sony
- `device-sony-<board>` from Sony where `<board>` is your phone platform, e.g.
  `device-sony-tone` for Xperia XZ
- `device-sony-<model-codename>` from Sony where `<model-codename>` is the
  codename of your device, e.g. `device-sony-kagura` for Xperia XZ
- [`repo`](http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo) from Google
- [`repo_update.sh`](https://github.com/sonyxperiadev/repo_update) script from Sony
- (Optional) my own additional script to apply patches called
  [`ix5_repo_update`](https://git.ix5.org/felix/ix5_repo_update)
- (Optional) Your own script to apply your own patches

You can then start tweaking and adding things. For example, you could add more
prebuilt apps into your build or add some xml files that e.g. [enable swipe-up
gestures by default](https://git.ix5.org/felix/vendor-sony-ix5/src/commit/3bbeeb0d66b0951bd1c5ffe33ac642bcff353d71/overlay/common/frameworks/base/core/res/res/values/config.xml#L28).
I would recommend you put your own changes into a separate `vendor/your-name`
directory instead of directly modifying `device/sony/common`.
You will need to include your own vendor directory,
see [this commit](https://git.ix5.org/felix/device-sony-common/commit/b115cc3f7f98c1d26a6bd8b84422706128e3d0b7)
for an example.

### Caveats

- Use the appropriate branch for your things at all times!
  It is tempting to test out patches from `master`, but be consistent.
- Cherry-pick carefully
- If anything goes wrong, use `repo forall -vc "git reset --hard"`
- If you must fork a repository, never commit your changes to the `master`
  branch, create a custom branch instead. This way, you can still pull from the
  "upstream" repo(i.e. the repo you forked it from) to `master` and then merge
  from `master` into your own custom branch. Otherwise you will run into merge
  conflicts very quickly.

### Tips

- It is way easier to write a patch and submit it than forking a
  repository and keeping it in sync with the upstream repo. If the maintainers do not accept your patch but you still
  need it, keep a branch in your forked repository for all your changes and only
  cherry-pick them with your own patch script. Take a look at
  [repo_update.sh](https://github.com/sonyxperiadev/repo_update)
  from sonyxperiadev for inspiration.
- Use overlays instead of modifying android_frameworks_base
